// HC55516/HC55532/HC55536/HC55564 - a CVSD voice decoder chip
//

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Overview
//
// The HC555XX is a CVSD (continuously variable slope delta) modulation 
// encoder/decoder chip.  CVSD modulation was popular in the 1980s for digital
// voice encoding, because it provides decent fidelity for voice audio at low
// bit rates.  CVSD happens to work particularly well with the spectrum
// properties of human voice signals, so it was mostly used for that, and in
// fact you still see CVSD encoding (although not this particular chip) used
// in some modern applications, especially military communications devices.
// It's also one of the codec types included in the Bluetooth specs.
//
// The core of a CVSD encoder/decoder is a "syllabic filter".  This isn't the
// sort of filter that removes unwanted frequency components from the output
// signal; rather, it's essentially an analog computing element that helps
// compute the output signal.  The syllabic filter is characterized by a
// time constant (4ms in the case of the HC55516), which is one of the key
// parameters controlling the CVSD's behavior, along with a pair of voltage
// levels feeding into the filter (the "high" and "low" syllabic filter
// inputs).  The data sheet for the HC55564 can still be found on the Web
// as of this writing, although the chip has been out of production for a
// very long time.
//
// Syllabic filters are defined in analog terms, but like any analog
// (that is, continuous-time) filter, they can be translated into the
// digital (discrete-time) domain.  The HC555xx chip was in fact a
// discrete-time implementation of the CVSD filter system.  A recent (2020)
// decap analysis of the HC55516 provided us with the exact algorithm and
// arithmetic parameters, which we now implement here.  The old MAME
// implementation was also a discrete-time implementation, implementing
// a digital version of the analog filter system specified in the data
// sheet.  The MAME version used IEEE floating-point types to implement
// the filter using the standard discrete-time algorithm for this type
// of filter.  Based on the decap, we can see that the HC555xx used the
// same mathematical model, but used 10- and 12-bit fixed-point arithmetic
// registers to perform the same calculations.  The arithmetic works out
// to be the same after taking into consideration the lower precision of
// the original hardware's registers, which shouldn't be surprising given
// that it would have to be essentially identical to work at all.  The
// old MAME version is arguably the "better" of the two implementations,
// in that it simulates the reference filter with greater mathematical
// precision, thanks to the higher precision of its intermediate results
// and accumulators.  The extremely limited precision of the original
// hardware results in greater rounding errors.  However, replicating
// the bit-for-bit identical arithmetic produces a more exact replica
// of the original output.  The difference in precision is probably too
// small to be audible even in theory, and certainly doesn't seem to be
// in practice.  The one significant difference between the two
// implementations is that we know from the decap what the clipping
// behavior is at the limits of the accumulator register ranges, which
// the old MAME implementation wasn't able to replicate, as it's not
// something we could have inferred from the reference filter spec in
// the data sheet.  The lack of proper clipping in the old PinMAME
// implementation motivated the addition of a loudness compression
// adjustment to handle the excessive dynamic range that resulted.  That
// might actually have been detrimentally audible.
//
// The HC55516 was part of a family of nearly identical chips that also
// included the HC55532, HC55536 and HC55564.  Apparently the only difference among
// these variations was the maximum sample clock rate supported (and some
// bugs, on the earlier revisions) and internal parameters, so they're
// essentially interchangeable (except for some very early machines, due to
// potential software timing bugs that the HC55516 could still cope with though).
// There's an unrelated family of CVSD decoders
// used in some older pinball machines, the MC3417 and MC3418, which have
// similar properties (in that they're also based on CVSD modulation) but
// aren't compatible with the HC555xx chips and had a somewhat different
// electrical setup (in particular, the MC341x chips used external analog
// components for the syllabic filter and estimator filter, whereas the
// HC555xx uses internal components and a purely digital implementation).
// The software emulations for the two chips are quite similar, and earlier
// versions of PinMAME used the same code for both, but we've separated
// them into their own modules now so that we can use the optimal numerical
// parameters and logic for each chip type.
// Note that apparently Williams/Bally themselves used a daughter board on
// late WPC releases (with the MC341X) if they couldn't get hold of enough HC555XX chips.
//
// The chief difficulty in implementing a good HC555xx decoder for PinMAME
// comes from the way the sample rate is handled in the original pinball
// machine hardware.  In particular, the original sound boards didn't use
// a fixed clock to generate the sample data.  Instead, they sent bits to
// the hardware on an ad hoc basis from the software.  That means that,
// first, the sample rate can't be determined by studying the hardware
// schematics, as the clock rate is purely at the whim of the software,
// and second, that the clock rate isn't perfectly uniform from bit to bit,
// as the software source can't be relied upon to generate bits with equal
// timing.  In practice, the actual elapsed time from bit to bit in the
// same clip can vary by as much as a factor of two.  A corollary to the
// first point - that the rate is controlled by the software - is that the
// rate on one pinball machine can vary from clip to clip, and in practice
// this actually happens on many games (e.g., most System 11 games have
// two different sample rates).
//
// Our strategy for handling the sample rate clock is to delay the decoding
// step as long as possible.  The MAME audio stream mechanism gives us some
// inherent backlogging, so we take advantage of that.  Rather than decoding
// the input bits as we receive them from the pinball sound board emulation,
// we collect them in a buffer, with timestamps.  When MAME calls upon us
// to fill its PCM stream buffer, we use the buffered samples to determine
// the HC55516 clock rate for that run of samples retrospectively.  That
// lets us average the clock rate over a large number of bits, smoothing
// out the highly variable per-bit timing.  In practice, we *can* rely on
// the average timing over a large number of bits being stable, because the
// original machines would have sounded terrible if they didn't accomplish
// that.
//
// Another aspect of the ad hoc sample rate that makes this difficult to
// implement in MAME is that MAME further processes our output in the 
// digital domain.  On the original pinball hardware, the output from the
// HC55516 chip was an analog signal that was processed from that point on 
// in the analog domain, so the sample rate that went into generating that 
// signal was irrelevant from that point forward.  But for our setup, we
// can't emulate the rest of the pipeline as though it were analog; we
// produce a digital PCM sample and have to hand off a PCM sample to our 
// next stage, the MAME stream.  The snag is that variable timing again!
// The MAME stream has its own clock rate, and we have an ad hoc clock
// rate from sample to sample.  We have to match the rates when handing
// the samples off to MAME by digitally resampling at the MAME rate. 
// Converting between dissimilar PCM rates is a tricky problem, but
// fortunately MAME already incorporates libsamplerate, which exists
// specifically to solve the resampling problem.  The solution to our
// clock rate mismatch is to use libamplerate as an intermediary.  We
// take each sample from our HC55516 output, feed it to a libsamplerate
// converter, and pass the resulting resampled signal to MAME.


/* Lord Nightmares additional comments on this chip emu:
The decap my research is based off of is an HC55516 (from https://seanriddle.com/55516die.html) however
this HC55516 die has the spaces on the die for two different sets of silicon vias (only one is populated
but changing this requires changing only one mask layer) and if you populate the 'missing' vias and remove
the others, the behavior changes to match the HC55532 datasheet (mostly).

I'm ASSUMING this is the correct behavior for HC55532, as we don't have a decap of an HC55532
(they're very rare, only made for 2 or 3 years).

We also do not (yet) have a decap of an HC55564 (and HC55536 which should be a simplified, cheaper,
decode-only HC55564), although the datasheet and apocryphal evidence leads me to believe that it behaves
like an HC55516, but possibly with 2 bugs fixed:

1) The HC55516 datasheet (at least the early ones, and some later ones) claims the /FZ input resets both
   the syllabic and integrator filter. The silicon tracing proves it doesn't, it just forces a constant
   alternating input, which takes a lot longer to zero the signal than the datasheet implies. I'm GUESSING
   the HC55564 fixed this so it actually zeroes the two digital filters.

   (additional comment from MJR: Those are interesting details about the /FZ behavior in his remarks -
    It doesn't look like it'll affect VPM, since VPM's version of the chip emulator doesn't even implement
    the /FZ line. It must have never been needed, presumably because it's not wired to a controlled input
    on any of the pinball sound boards. I spot-checked a couple of System 11 schematics just now,
    and /FZ is indeed just pulled high on the ones I checked)

2) The HC55516 and HC55532 have a bug with the way the signed integrator filter decays toward zero by 1/16
   (or 1/32 for HC55532) of its current value each clock cycle, where, if the current value is positive,
   the filter will get stuck with a value of 0xF or 0x1F (for 55516 and 55532 respectively) in the integrator
   and never decay to truly zero. I believe this bug was fixed in the HC55564 and HC55536, which presumably
   allowed for eliminating a weird DC offset hack circuit which takes up a significant portion of the die.

//
// Implementation selection
//
// There are now two implementations of the HC555xx family:
//
// * The original PinMAME implementation, which uses the standard discrete-
//   time filter algorithms to create a model of the ideal syllabic filter
//   per the published specifications in the HC55516 data sheet
//
// * A new HC555xx logic simulation, which re-creates the exact bit logic
//   implemented in the HC555xx chips, as determined by a 2020 decap
//   analysis of a specimen of the physical chip.
//
// The two implementations perform essentially identical math, since they're
// both implementing the same discrete-time filter system.  The old PinMAME
// version implements the math using native 'double' types, whereas the chip
// logic uses 10- and 12-bit 2's complement integer registers (which aren't
// actually integer values mathematically throughout the calculation: the
// chip is also doing fractional arithmetic, but doing so using explicit
// bit shifts rather than implicitly using C operators with floating-point
// types).  The old PinMAME version executes the intermediate calculations
// at higher precision than the chip, due to the wider registers it uses,
// but at the cost of some discrepancy from the exact bit values produced
// by the chip, due to the greater rounding error with the chip's narrow
// registers.
//
// You can select which implementation you want here.  The selection can
// be changed at run-time, although at the moment this isn't exposed as a
// user-configuration parameter.  The selection must be made prior to
// initialization, since it's fixed into the chip state structures once
// those are created.
//
// The two versions sound identical subjectively.  The old PinMAME version
// is a more accurate model of the abstract mathematical filter that the
// chip purports to implement, but the hardware logic version is a more
// accurate re-creation of the chip, and should exactly match its output
// as far as the chip's internal DAC stage.  (We obviously can't truly
// replicate anything beyond that, since the rest of the hardware system
// is in the analog domain.)
//
//   0 -> use the original PinMAME implementation
//   1 -> use the chip logic simulation

// ***** CLOCK RATE MEASUREMENT AND LOGGING *****
//
// The HC55516 doesn't have a fixed sample data rate; the rate is simply
// the speed at which the host sends samples.  If you want to determine the
// rate for a given pinball machine, this code has a rate logging feature
// you can enable.  This requires a special debug build:
//
// 1. Un-comment the line beneath this comment block
// 2. Rebuild PinMAME
// 3. Run the game you want to measure
// 4. Look through the file <ROM>.vpm_hc55516_bitrate.log
// 5. Add a call to hc55516_set_sample_clock() in init_GAME()
//
// The file <ROM>.vpm.hc55516.log will contain information on the clock
// rate as samples are played.  WPC89 games all use the same fixed clock
// rate (22372 Hz).  Most System 11 games use two different clock rates,
// with some clips playing at one rate and some at the other.  In
// principle, each clip could even have a unique rate.
//
// In the first iteration of the 2019 revamp of this code, we thought it 
// was going to be necessary (or would at least improve playback) to 
// pre-set the clock rate per game, so we added a routine to do this
// (hc55516_set_sample_clock()) and added corresponding calls to this
// routine to some init_GAME().  This didn't turn out to be needed after
// reworking the hc55516 code some more, but we left the routine and
// calls intact to preserve the sample rate measurements, in case they
// become useful again in the future.  At the moment, there's no need to
// add more of these, as the information is ignored if provided at all.

// Gain Selection
//
// The HC55516 emulation works in terms of a simulated analog voltage level 
// at the HC55516 analog output pin (pin 3, AO, on the real chips).  MAME,
// in contrast, works in terms of 16-bit PCM samples.  So we have to convert
// from the simulated analog voltage to a 16-bit PCM level.  
//
// Both formats represent linear wave amplitudes, so the general-purpose way 
// to select the gain is to choose the value that preserves the identical 
// dynamic range:  that is, the gain that maps the maximum analog voltage to 
// the maximum PCM value.  We use loudness compression curve with an input
// dynamic range of -DYN_RANGE_MAX to +DYN_RANGE_MAX (see below).  We 
// ultimately convert this to the INT16 range in the range compression step,
// but the initial gain calculation targets the wider range before compression.
// So the default gain is DYN_RANGE_MAX/V_HIGH.
//
// In practice, some games don't use all of the available dynamic range on
// the CVSD side.  It can be more pleasing in these cases to use a higher 
// than default gain that converts all of the actually used dynamic range on
// the CVSD side to the full scale on the PCM side, or (DYN_RANGE_MAX /
// highest actual voltage level).
//
// To aid in selecting an ideal per-game gain, you can enable dynamic range
// logging by #define'ing LOG_DYN_RANGE below.  That will generate a log file
// (<ROM NAME>.vpm_hc55516_dynrange.log) containing periodic updates with
// the maximum sample level seen so far, and the computed "max non-clipping 
// gain" (the gain that maps the maximum sample level to PCM full scale).

// Syllabic filter constants.  For an RC filter, the charge factor per
// clock period is given by:
//
//   exp(-clock_period/time_constant)
//
// where clock_period = 1/frequency and time_constant is the filter's RC
// time constant.  For normal analog filters, this would make the charge
// factor dependent upon the data clock frequency.  However, the HC55516
// data sheet has a note claiming that both of its filter time constants
// (syllabic filter and signal estimator, aka integrator) are inversely
// proportional to the data clock frequency.  That effectively makes the
// charge factors independent of the clock frequency, because:
//
//    time_constant = P / frequency  [where P is some constant value]

// divided by the maximum analog voltage.  The maximum analog output voltage
// from a CVSD decoder is the same as the "high" input to the syllabic filter.
// (The physical HC55516 technically doesn't quite work that way, as it uses
// a digital implementation of the signal estimator filter, just like we do,
// and uses an internal DAC to convert that modeled filter to a true analog

// of the physical chip, so for the purposes of our mathematical model, the
// estimator filter is analog.)
//
// This is only the default gain.  The actual gain can be set at run-time

// This version uses a fixed-point fraction implementation, based on the 2020

// here are done using 10- and 12-bit 2's complement integer registers, which 
// are interpreted in some of the intermediate steps as fixed-point fraction
// values.  The arithmetic is essentially the same as the original PinMAME
// implementation - not surprising, since both are implementing the same
// system of discrete-time filters.  But the correspondence is hard to see
// because the arithmetic here looks like integer arithmetic (which isn't
// entirely true; it uses native integer types, but it's actually performing
// fixed-point fraction arithmetic in some of the intermediate steps).  It's
// also difficult to see what's really going on arithmetically because some
// of the arithmetic primitives that a modern C program would express in
// terms of C arithmetic operators are decomposed into their constituent
// bit-twiddling operations, which obscures what they're really computing.
//
// One thing that's helpful in understanding the corresponding to the real
// arithmetic going on is to recognize is that (~N + 1) == -N for 2's
// complement representation, and thus ~N = -N - 1.  The chip's pipeline
// uses this idiom because it's more economical in a hardware layout to
// use a bunch of bit inverters than to implement a 2's-complement "negate"
// operation, since that requires a separate adder step.  This idiom is
// also used to express a subtraction as a bitwise NOT combined with an
// add.  Another obfuscating factor is that the syllabic filter is
// represented in the original hardware as a 12-bit signed integer register,
// and the integrator is a 10-bit signed integer register, so many of the
// operations in the C conversion need additional masking steps to replicate
// the behavior of the hardware, where bits would just fall off the high
// end of the register after an add or shift.  I've cleaned things up a
// little bit (from the baseline MAME implementation) to make the intent 
// clearer.  But I've also deliberately maintained fidelity to the chip's
// exact series of bit operations, so it's still pretty hard to follow 
// what's really going on.  The overall calculation, though, maps very
// directly to the floating-point version, so you can use that as a
// reference to see what the abstract mathematical formulas really are.

	// instead.  It's not at all obvious that the MAME code expresses
	// the same operation as this nice simple math formula, so let's
	// look at what's going on in the bit logic.  The first line in the
	// MAME code masks the value to the low-order 10 bits (setting all

	// order bits zeroed.  On the original HC55516 hardware, this
	// number is *physically* stored in a 10-bit register, so there
	// actually are no higher-order bits to store - that's why MAME
	// has to zero them.  But the HC hardware thinks about this 10-bit
	// register as a signed 2's-complement value.  What does that mean
	// for the C translation?  It means that if the high-order bit of
	// this 10-bit value is '1', the 10-bit value is negative, so we
	// need our wider native C value to ALSO be negative.  How do we
	// make it negative?  By filling all of the higher-order bits
	// with '1' bits.  That's what that second line is doing: it's
	// testing the sign bit of the 10-bit value, at bit 0x200, and
	// if it's set (meaning the 10-bit value is negative), it fills
	// in all of the higher-order bits in the native C 'v' with '1'
	// bits.  If bit 0x200 is zero, it does nothing, leaving the
